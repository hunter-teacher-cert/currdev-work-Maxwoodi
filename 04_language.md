I opted to select the Racket Language to be taught to students who have completed algebra 1 and who may be currectly taking geometry or have taken geometry but have not taken AP CSP. This new course will be called Programming for Geometry.
Racket is a fun programming language built on the concepts of variables and functions as they are presented in mathematics. The Racket language, conceptualizes geometric shapes as functions when used in conjunction with its picture libraries. However, in Racket geometry shapes are also defined in terms of their colors and shapes.
Each line of Racket code begins as a function ( example: (rectangle 105 60 "solid", "orange") ). The function name is followed by  parameters that Racket requires for that particular function. Advanced students may import their own images for manipulation in Racket. The coder then types, Run, located at the top right of the screen in the definition window. Coding in Racket is relatively simple.
The strengths of Racket include: ease of coding, visual applications of known mathematics concepts such as variables, functions, and geometric shapes while creating an environment for student creativity. Further, educators may use Racket as a gateway for introducing their students to other languages such as Pyret followed by Python or directly to Python. 
Unlike Java, the Racket language does not allow for setting the values of variables in loops, variables cannot be declared without giving them values, there is no return at all, and Racket programmers hardly every use classes with mutable fields. However, these weaknesses may be mitigated by exploiting the strengths of Racket cited above by using known concepts such as variables, functions, and geometric shapes along with it ease of use to teach programming best practices. This language was chosen because students can learn important programming and mathematical skills while having fun.
