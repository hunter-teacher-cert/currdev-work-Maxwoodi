I will compare and contrast the AP College Board AP CSA curriculum with the CSAwesome AP CSA curriculum. I am using the AP College Board suggested
curriculum as outlined in AP Classroom to prepare my students for the AP CSA exam. Four major headings will guide this assignment. 
These headings are: major differences, major similarities, comparative strengths and weaknesses, and whether I would adopt
anything from the curriculum that I do not use at this time. 


Major Differences

* The CSAwesome curriculum is more interactive than the College Board curriculum.
* The CSAwesome curriculum has actual pre-packaged teacher lesson plans while the College Board curriculum only provides lesson content
   with no actual pre-packaged lesson.
* Coding assignmnents can be written and run within the CSAwesome environment. No external IDE is needed. 
* The College Board curriculum allows for greater teacher choice from actual past and future AP CSA exam questions while the CSAwesome curriculum is very limited in this regard.
* The College Board curriculum allows the teacher to teach solo,teach by using video lessons provided by experienced educators, and experts or to assign the video lessons and/or items from the question bank to students. 
 

Major Similarities

* Both curricula are online.
* They both use the same order of topics.
* Both curricula are free of cost.
* Both curricula can be implemented in a self-paced manner.

Comparative Strengths and Weaknesses

One strength of the CSAwesome curriculum is that the interactive lessons can be easily initiated by a student. No overt teacher guidance is required. However, this strengths
makes it AP CSA exam - lite. On the other hand, the AP College board curriculum videos seem to be more appropriately set at the level required by the AP CSA exam. However, this 
strength requires overt teacher support to bridge the gap betwen the expert videos and the AP Exam questions.

Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not use? Why?

I would adopt the pre-packaged lesson plans and the opportunity for students to run their code in the CSAwesome environment. The adoption of these two CSAwesome features
would increase the ease-of-use for both teachers and students using the AP CSA curriculum.
